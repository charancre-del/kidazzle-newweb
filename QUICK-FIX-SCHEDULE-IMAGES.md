## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Featured Image box"
- Click **Screen Options** (top right corner)
- Check the **"Featured Image"** checkbox
- The box should now appear on the right sidebar

### "The image is too small/blurry"
- Upload a higher resolution image (minimum 800px wide)
- Re-set the featured image

### "Images still not showing on homepage"
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear WordPress cache if using caching plugin
- Wait 30 seconds and refresh again

### "I only have 3 programs, not 6"
- That's fine! Set featured images only on programs you have
- Each program that appears in schedule tabs needs an image
